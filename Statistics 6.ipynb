    "The t-test and z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The primary difference between the two lies in the assumptions about the population and the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption:**\n",
    "   - The t-test assumes that the population follows a normal distribution or that the sample size is sufficiently large for the Central Limit Theorem to apply.\n",
    "   - It is particularly useful for small sample sizes when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Size:**\n",
    "   - T-tests are generally more appropriate when the sample size is small (typically less than 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formulas:**\n",
    "   - There are different types of t-tests, such as one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, and paired sample t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example Scenario:**\n",
    "   - You might use a t-test when comparing the mean scores of two groups of students who were taught using different teaching methods. The sample sizes for each group are relatively small (e.g., 20 students in each group).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Z-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption:**\n",
    "   - The z-test assumes that the population follows a normal distribution, and it is generally used when the sample size is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sample Size:**\n",
    "   - Z-tests are more suitable when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formulas:**\n",
    "   - The z-test formula involves the standard normal distribution, and it is often used when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example Scenario:**\n",
    "   - Consider a scenario where you want to compare the mean heights of all male adults in a city to a known population mean height. If you have a large random sample (e.g., 1000 individuals) and you know the population standard deviation of male adult heights, you might use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",

    "Let's say you are conducting a study to compare the average commute times between two different transportation modes (car and public transportation) in a city:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **T-Test Scenario:**\n",
    "  - You collect commute time data from a random sample of 20 individuals for each mode. Since the sample sizes are small, and you don't know the population standard deviation, you opt for a two-sample t-test to compare the means.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-Test Scenario:**\n",
    "  - Now, suppose you have access to a large dataset with commute time information for 1000 individuals for each mode. Given the larger sample sizes, and assuming the population standard deviation is known (perhaps from historical data), you might choose to use a z-test for this scenario.\n",

If the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown, a t-test is often more appropriate. If the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known, a z-test might be suitable."

    "In hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur: Type I error and Type II error. These errors are associated with decisions made based on the results of a statistical test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type I Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Definition:**\n",
    "   - Type I error occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis. In other words, it is the error of concluding that there is a significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is none.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Example Scenario:**\n",
    "   - Suppose a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug. The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that the drug has no effect, but the researchers incorrectly reject it and conclude that the drug is effective when, in fact, it has no effect.\n",

    "3. **Example Scenario:**\n",

    "### Balancing Type I and Type II Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significance Level (\\(\\alpha\\)):**\n",
    "  - Researchers can control the Type I error rate by choosing a lower significance level (e.g., 0.01 instead of 0.05). However, this may increase the risk of Type II errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power of the Test:**\n",
    "  - Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (1 - \\(\\beta\\)).\n",
    "  - Increasing the sample size or improving the test's sensitivity can enhance the power of the test, reducing the risk of Type II errors.\n",

    "- **Type II Error (False Negative):**\n",
    "  - Incorrectly concluding that there is no effect or difference when there is one.\n",
    "  - Probability denoted by \\(\\beta\\).\n",
